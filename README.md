## Before you get started... ##

This project is very simple but un-polished. Only working code is committed,
but don't expect much... because it was the itch I was scratching, this
program only provides memory info for the time being.

## Installation ##
To get going, install dependencies by cloning this project, entering the
project directory, and installing packages:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
